### DraughtsAI

#### This repo is dedicated to my draughts/checkers AI program 
#### Over the course of this year, I will be updating it constantly so, hopefully, I will have a full draughts AI operating by next year

#### GUI and Minimax sorted 
#### DeepQ network learning now 
#### I'm attempting to train it against MiniMax

#### Side note - all file with SCRAP are spare files that have no particular use atm
